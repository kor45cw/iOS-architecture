# iOS-architecture
A collection of samples to discuss and showcase different architectural tools and patterns for iOS apps.

## Choose a sample for your app

Each sample includes a dedicated `README.md` file where you can find related metrics, as well as subjective assessments and observations by contributors. The following factors are worth considering when selecting a particular sample for your app:

* The size of the app you are developing
* The size and experience of your team
* The amount of maintenance that you are expecting to have to do
* Your preference for the compactness of your codebase


## Open a sample in Xcode

To open one of the samples in Xcode, begin by checking out one of the sample branches, and then open the `sample/` directory in Xcode.

**Note:** The master branch does not compile.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:kor45cw/ios-architecture.git
```

Checkout the todo-mvp sample:
```
git checkout mvp 
```

Pod install:
```
cd sample
pod install
```

**Note:** To review a different sample, replace `mvp` with the name of sample you want to check out.

Finally open the `sample/` directory in Xcode
